This directory contains example input decks for SUTTG. The input decks
generate the outputs given in the "data" directory. The contents of
the examples are as follows.

waterfullopt97-1p0fast.xml:
waterfullopt97-1p0opta.xml:
waterfullopt97-1p0optb.xml:

  These three examples all utilize the IAPWS-IF97 model. The
  tabulation is performed over the full range of the model at a rather
  coarse tolerance. This allows a quick demonstration of the algorithms
  and a means to test the code. The first deck uses the fast algorithm,
  the second the optimize algorithm with a step multiplier, and the
  third the optimize algorithm with no step multiplier. The effect of
  the algorithm on table size can be seen in the corresponding data
  tables.

waterfullopt97-0p1optb.xml:

  This example also uses the IAPWS-IF97 model tabulated over the full
  range of the model using the best optimization settings at a 10%
  tolerance. This table is likely suitable for use in prototyping
  simulations.

waterfullopt95-1p0fast.xml:

  This example uses the IAPWS95 model at a coarse tolerance and the
  fast algorithm. This is mainly for code verification.

waterhighp95-0p01optb.xml:

  This example shows how one may reduce the range of the table to
  speed up generation and reduce table size. The IAPWS95 model is
  tabulated to a 1% tolerance. The model is not tabulated below 290 K or
  10 bar, but otherwise includes the full range.
